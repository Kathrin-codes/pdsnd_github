### Project Title
Interactive analysis of bikeshare data in three different cities

### Description
The program allows the user to review bikeshare data from three different cities, i.e. Chicago, New York and Washington.
An interactive approach guides the user through the following steps:
- Choose which city to look at
- Filter the data by month or day
- Provide statistical data for the specified city and time filter
- Choose whether or not to see detailed data

### Files used
Besides the python file, the csv files have been hidden using .gitignore.
These csv files include bikeshare data from the three different cities.
